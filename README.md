# üìà Key Insights
### üî• 1. Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
We identified the top 10 skills required for Data Analysts by counting the number of job postings requiring each skill.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills, 
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
left JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
where 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

```

### üíº 4. Top Paying Jobs for Data Analysts
I extracted job postings that offer the highest salaries for Data Analysts.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_postings_fact.job_id,
    job_postings_fact.job_title,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_postings_fact.job_location,
    job_postings_fact.job_schedule_type,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
    job_postings_fact.job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
left join company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
where 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg is not NULL AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
order by 
    salary_year_avg DESC
limit 10;
```

### üíº 5. Top Skills Based on salary
I extracted the top 20 highest-paying skills for Data Analysts using SQL by analyzing job postings that include salary information. The data was gathered by joining job postings with skill records, filtering for "Data Analyst" roles, and calculating the average salary for each skill.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills, 
    round(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS Average_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
left JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
where 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND salary_year_avg is not NULL
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skills
order BY
    Average_salary DESC
LIMIT 20; 
```
